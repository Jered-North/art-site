	<p class="home-paragraph-2">Her process is unique for every piece. It begins with an idea, a sketch, and then the sketch takes on a life of its own. It speaks for itself, and practically chooses what media will be put next. Because of this, she has learned to use one material in a thousand different ways through experimentation... And still discovers more!

	She also teaches art classes and workshops. Feel free to inquire about these events and the pricing of her classes.â€‹</p>
